/********* Lec-14 (Array)**********/
/* 1.Arrays are objects storing collection of multiple items under a single variable name 
2. Here arrays can be resixed and contain heterogenous data types
3. Here any value can be accessed only through index values as numeric values of the index of an element of the array
4. Array indices start from zero



5. Arrays on copy ops here form shallow copies mean they share the same reference point i.e. if we make change in the copied values then they reflect in the original array also.



Deep copy : Here the changes made in copied array isnt reflected on the original one bcz the reference is not the same */

// Array Methods 

myArr.push(6)

console.log(myArr);// two values added at the end 
myArr.pop()// Removes the last element of the array

myArr.unshift(9)// adds the value at the beginnig but its used only when very much required bcz it needs all the values to be shifted by their positions 
myArr.shift()// removes the first elemnt from the array
